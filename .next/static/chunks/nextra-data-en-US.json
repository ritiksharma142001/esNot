When a user fills out a registration form on the client-side (handled by React.js, Angular.js, Vue.js, etc.), this data is sent to the server-side (Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, PHP, etc.). The server processes the data, securely stores user information in a database, and then sends a confirmation back to the client-side. When the user attempts to login, the server verifies the entered credentials against the stored data and, if valid, sends a response back to the client-side to grant the user access.","Ô∏è-summary#üóíÔ∏è Summary":"While exploring this example, if you encounter aspects that are unclear or confusing, remember there are resources available to help.
