# Week 10 Assignment

| Assessment             | Weight (%)         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| Assignments            | 10 x 5% each = 50% |
| Project Topic          | 10%                |
| Project Implementation | 40%                |
| **Total**              | **100%**           |

## Prerequisites

[student repositories](/student-work/github-accounts).

Create a `week-10` folder in your Next.js project and copy the contents of your `week-9` folder into it.

## Part 2: Add Cloud Firestore in Firebase

<Steps>

### Firebase console

Navigate to the Firebase console (https://console.firebase.google.com/) and to the project you created in Week 8.

### Add Cloud Firestore service

Under the Product Categories menu on the left, click "Build" and then click on the "Cloud Firestore".

Click on the "Create database" button.

In the pop-up window, use the default settings and click "Next".

Select "Start in production mode" and click "Enable".

### Configure Firestore rules

Click on the "Rules" tab and replace the default rules with the following. These rules will only allow authenticated users (`request.auth != null`) to read and write to their own documents (`request.auth.uid == userId`). These rules are "good enough" for security purposes.

```js copy
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
        match /items/{itemId} {
          allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Feel free to try the following more restrictive rules. However, you will need to ensure that your data structure matches the rules exactly.



Click on the "Publish" button to publish the new rules.

</Steps>

### User Registration and Authentication

A commonplace feature in web applications is the ability for users to register and login. When a user fills out a registration form on the client-side (handled by React.js, Angular.js, Vue.js, etc.), this data is sent to the server-side (Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, PHP, etc.). The server processes the data, securely stores user information in a database, and then sends a confirmation back to the client-side. When the user attempts to login, the server verifies the entered credentials against the stored data and, if valid, sends a response back to the client-side to grant the user access.

> While exploring this example, if you encounter aspects that are unclear or confusing, remember there are resources available to help. You can rely on [AI-powered tools](/guides-and-references/course-info#specific-use-cases-for-ai-tools) to answer specific questions or provide further explanations on topics you find challenging. Another valuable resource is your instructor, who has a deep understanding of the topic and can clarify complex concepts, explain the code in a different way, or help troubleshoot any issues you might be facing. Don't hesitate to seek help when needed. Learning is a journey, and asking questions is an essential part of the process.
