# Week 2 Assignment

## Overview

In this assignment, you will create a new Next.js project. You will create a new page for `week-2` and a React component. You will also edit the root page of the project.

The Next.js project that you create here will be used for all of the assignments in this course. You will add new weekly folders to the project for each assignment.

## Part 1: Create a New Next.js Project

Follow the [Guide: Creating a New Next.js Project](/guides-and-references/creating-new-nextjs-project) to create a new Next.js project. The project name and GitHub repository name must be `cprg306-assignments`.

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";



## Part 2: Create a New Page for `week-2`, a React Component, and Edit the Root Page

import { Steps } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Steps>

### Create `week-2` Page

In the project `app` folder, create a new **folder** called `week-2`.

In the `week-2` folder, create a new **file** called `page.js`.

In the `week-2/page.js` file, enter the following code to display a heading:

```jsx copy
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Shopping List</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Try out the new page! In the browser, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/week-2`. You should see the heading displayed. Don't worry about the styling for now.

### Create `StudentInfo` Component

In the `week-2` folder, create a file called `student-info.js`.

In the `student-info.js` file, code a React component called `StudentInfo` that renders (displays) the following information:

- Your name
- A link to your GitHub repository

<Callout type="info" emoji="️💡">
You should use `Link` component from Next.js to link to your GitHub repository. Do not use the HTML anchor tag directly.

The component should be exported as the default export.

</Callout>

### Render `StudentInfo` in `week-2` Page

In the `week-2/page.js` file, import the `StudentInfo` component you created in the previous step.

Render (display) the `StudentInfo` component below the heading tag.

After every change, you should view the page in the browser to make sure it is working as expected. You should see the heading and your name and GitHub link displayed.

### Edit Root Page

The root page is the page that is displayed when you navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. It is the `page.js` file in the project `/app` folder.

Edit the root page and remove all of the code. You will replace it with new code.

The root page should contain the following:

- The heading: CPRG 306: Web Development 2 - Assignments
- A link to the `week-2` page you created above

</Steps>

### Additional information

The [Guide: Coding Workflow](/guides-and-references/workflow) may help you with the coding workflow.

There is no requirement to deploy the application, but you may do so if you wish. See [Guide: Deploying a Next.js Application](/guides-and-references/deploying-nextjs-app) for instructions.

### Example Output

Root page: [https://cprg306-assignments.vercel.app](https://cprg306-assignments.vercel.app)

Week 2 page: [https://cprg306-assignments.vercel.app/week-2](https://cprg306-assignments.vercel.app/week-2)

## Part 3: Assignment Submission

The instructor will be able to find your assignment in your GitHub repository. Make sure you have committed and pushed your changes to GitHub before the assignment deadline.

Ensure the following:

- You have completed the previous assignment and that the instructor has your GitHub username.
- The GitHub repository is **public** and named exactly `cprg306-assignments`.
- The weekly folder is named exactly `week-2` (lowercase) and contains the `page.js` file.
