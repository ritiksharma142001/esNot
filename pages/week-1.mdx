> **Good to know**:
>
> - The `.js`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` file extensions can be used for Pages.
> - A page is always the [leaf](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#terminology) of the [route subtree](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#terminology).
> - A `page.js` file is required to make a route segment publicly accessible.
> - Pages are [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) by default, but can be set to a [Client Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).
> - Pages can fetch data. View the [Data Fetching](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching) section for more information.
