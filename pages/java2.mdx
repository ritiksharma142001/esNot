REST APIs  
REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services.

- **GET /users**: Retrieve a list of all users.

### What does Stateless mean in REST API?
- A REST API is like a delivery service. Imagine you order food every day, but each time, you need to tell the delivery person your full address and what you want. The delivery person doesn't remember your previous orders or address; you have to give them all the details again every time.
- In the same way, a stateless REST API means the server doesn't remember anything from your previous requests. Every time you send a new request, you need to include everything the server needs to know, like your identity or what data you need.
- So, stateless means each request stands alone and doesn't depend on past requests.
